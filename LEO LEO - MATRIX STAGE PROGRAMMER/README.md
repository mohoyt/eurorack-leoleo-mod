# Leo Leo - The Matrix Programmer

<img src="./Images/leo_leo_profile.jpg" height="400px">

Features:

"Leo Leo" (faster in thai) is a programmer/sequencer module based on the first original Serge Programmer from the 70s, after discussing with Elby Designs and Serge himself who gave me open direction for this project, alongside some recommendations, I am happy to share here my evolution of the Programmer as an open source DIY project, this is quite the module and requires proper context, demonstration and education, below are a list of videos I've made myself to cover all the different aspects of this module.

To make it simpler for now, think of it as a, 4x4, 2x8, 2x16 analog Step Sequencer with individual CV outs per stage/step plus special sequential outs as well as a "ABCD" and "DCBA" outputs.

There's no notion of clock, so there's no internal clocking, you have inputs to make the programmer active from left to right, right to left and/or top to bottom and on each direction you take you can define rules per stage/step on what should happen (skip, mute, stop, play).

This is module to explore for sure, if I have you interest still, then please feel free to browse around my list of videos below about this special module.

Demos: Coming soon!

## Build Instructions
* You can easiliy order all needed components from [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com) online shop simply by uploading the ["Tayda Auto Order"](./Tayda%20Auto%20Order.csv) CSV file at https://www.taydaelectronics.com/quick-order/
* Print out the BOM file
* Please keep in mind that also the frontpanel should be produced in FR4 material when ordering it and not in aluminium (Just use the same material to build the PCBs and Front Panel) since the lightning effect only works with the FR4 material
* Follow the build instructions documentation PDF
